# Assignment_6.1
To generate a Vander monde matrix. The columns of the output matrix are powers of the input vector. The order of the powers is determined by the `increasing` boolean argument. Specifically, when `increasing` is False, the `i`-th output column is the input vector raised element-wise to the power of ``N - i - 1``.
